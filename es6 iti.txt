var vs let vs const 
 
 var
   - is global scope 
   - any varible is declared using var is hosted 
       - hoisting meaning : any varible declaration is going to the top of the code 

 let declaration using let is not hoisted 
      * so u should define it first then u use it  
      * their scope the block in wich they are defined , as will as in any contained sub block
  
 const :
   - variable declared using const are constant variable , 
     you cant assign to anoter value to them ,
      except at the point where they are declared . 
   - a constant can be global or local to a function where it is declared . 
   - constants also share a feature with variables declared using let in that they are block-scoped
        instead of function-scoped (and thus they are not hoisted )
